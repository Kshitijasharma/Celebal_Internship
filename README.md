## WEEK-4 : Outlier Handling with Standardization and Min-Max Scaling
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to handle outliers in a dataset using two different scaling methods: Standardization (Z-score normalization) and Min-Max scaling. It includes examples using a dataset from Seaborn's built-in datasets.

### OVERVIEW
Outliers in datasets can significantly impact statistical analyses and machine learning models. This repository provides methods to replace outliers using two common scaling techniques:

Standardization (Z-score normalization):

Adjusts data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Less sensitive to outliers compared to Min-Max scaling.
Min-Max Scaling:

Scales data to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
Preserves the original distribution but can be sensitive to outliers.
The code includes functions to visualize boxplots before and after outlier replacement using both methods.

### DEPENDENCIES
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

-> seaborn
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> matplotlib
-> scikit-learn
